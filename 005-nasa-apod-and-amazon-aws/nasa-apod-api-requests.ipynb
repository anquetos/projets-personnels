The missing part, which included the center from some locations, just went behind the Moon in what is known as an annular solar eclipse.  Featured here is an eclipse sequence taken as the Moon was overtaking the rising Sun in the sky. The foreground hill is Factory Butte in Utah, USA. The rays flaring out from the Sun are not real -- they result from camera aperture diffraction and are known as sunstar. The Moon is real, but appears only in silhouette in this ring-of-fire eclipse. As stunning as this eclipse sequence is, it was considered just practice by the astrophotographer.  The reason? She hopes to use this experience to better photograph the total solar eclipse that will occur over North America on April 8, 2024.

Most of Neptune's atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium, which is invisible.

       " 'explanation': 'Have you ever seen the Andromeda galaxy? Although M31 appears as a faint and fuzzy blob to the unaided eye, the light you see will be over two million years old, making it likely the oldest light you ever will see directly. The featured image captured Andromeda just before it set behind the Swiss Alps early last year. As cool as it may be to see this neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way with your own eyes, long duration camera exposures can pick up many faint and breathtaking details. The image is composite of foreground and background images taken consecutively with the same camera and from the same location.  Recent data indicate that our Milky Way Galaxy will collide and coalesce with Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.
